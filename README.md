# costas-gis
Back-end application of the geographic information system, responsible for managing the public business licenses in the coast of Spain. It provides the necessary REST services for the Web and mobile apps. It’s written in C# using .NET Framework 4.5, in particular: Web API 2 for the RESTful services layer and ADO .NET Entity Framework 6 as ORM.
<p></p>
Some of the most representative services the application provides are:
<p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Capacity to import the Geographic and alphanumeric data of the public licences from a KML file and store it in a spatial database.
<p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● CRUD operations against the set of licenses.<p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Geometry conversion from cartesian coordinates to latitude/longitude system for each license.<p></p>


This application is part of my Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering final project. There are two other client applications (Web and mobile) completing the project:
<p></p>
Web client https://github.com/juansgt/costas-gis-web
<p></p>
Mobile client (Android) https://github.com/juansgt/costas-gis-android
